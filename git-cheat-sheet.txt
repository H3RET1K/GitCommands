--clone existing repository from GitHub account to local

--the -m will specify the comment appended to the commit action

--this will upload my currently checked out master branch to my GitHub
--there is no need to specify the origin, since it is defaulted from the initial clone

git push GitCommands_RM
--a standard git push will only upload the checked out branch
--I want to also push my GitCommands_RM branch to GitHub as well
